# browsertitlefrommenu
 Joomla 5 System Plugin to automatically set the Browser Title from the Menu Title

## QUICK AND DIRTY - use at own risk
 Until Joomla 4 the default Browser Page Title - the <title> tag was generated from the *Menu Title* if it wasn't set manually.
 In Joomla 5 the default Browser Page Title is taken from the *Article Title*

 If you relied on the Menu Titles and don't feel like updating all the Page Titles by hand, you might find this here useful. 

 If you have ideas to improve on it, feel free. Just keep in mind that I am a complete GitHub noob ;)
